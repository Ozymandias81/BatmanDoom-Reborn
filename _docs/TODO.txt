Considerations of mine:
Add a titlemap like Urban Brawl style;
Replace all actors with DENum's newer ones;
Zeke rotating sprites are really odd: sometimes molotov on the right hand, then on the left now
Bane needs some effects like Hexen bishops & minotaur, earthquakes and Venom power (must see what's meant for, don't know exactly this character);

Mav3rick playtesting:
==FIXED==
*1) i notice that in the map there is no enemies count to display but can see how many secrets
*2) the batarang still keep activating enemies
*5) the health pick ups maybe will be better if they have a batman air and the blue health potions too, they seem to be out of place on gotham
*7) batman still make doomguy sounds
*8) the ninja at the begining have a funny jumping attack that kill you almost instantly
*9) when fighting killer croc if you let him pick up a boulder and you hit it, it will vanish from his hands and also from the map giving space
*10) ninja fight 8/10 that killer jump is hard
*11) croc 6/10 because that little glich with the rocks getting vanished, he is no too aggresive
*13) the pick up ammo for the smoke bomb and weapons in general is the shotgun one :P
*16) will be tell more as i do more progress, oh and the Tally Man was not hard, maybe if you wanna make him move faster will be a hard enemy
==TOFIX==
3) also will be cool a new sprite for the batarang i will try to see if find one ;) and also make it more faster after all they suppoce to move silent and deadly
4) since he is batman and have a bat belt, maybe he should have in his inventory a night vision goggles or bat vision for those dark places ;) a portable medkit with 100 health since levels give almost no health and is very annoying, i guess you can grab the goggles and medkit from blood 1 and use them for those items :)
6) the armor pick up as the health pick up is very rare and poor on levels, maybe raising their value to 10 or 5 to give some edge
12) well i have played some more and i notice that the chinese enemies the one that throw you stars, when they hit u with their claws it make a matalic sound hit, maybe if the sound will be a ripping or tearing clothes will be more accurate and also the big guy with knife too ;)
14) maybe adding some "its batman" to the enemies may give some live the moment since they seems to never know with who they are fighting, even will be cool also give some lines to the bosses ;)
15) so far im a little stuck in the mission of the gas with the penguin, since as i told you before the health is low and that level there is plenty of zones that hurt the player, will play and see if there is a secret with health or something to let me progress :)

Hi Ozy :D long time buddy, hey i was playing more batman reborn and see if finally end it, and give u some more feedback as im moving on it ;)
there r few for now and yes i know u r working on wolfdoom ;) so no worries is better have all info there for future improvement or changes.

In A.. there is a problem with the aim level on all weapons, the bullets hits the lower part of where the crosshair is, causing problem when shoting mines or enemies on weird places
B.. when u get aligned with the walls the bullets dont fly over and hit the enemies, they just hit the wall down, and i dont use auto aim, no idea why it happens, no matter the distance
C.. the bushes r rock solid 
D.. self explanatory
E.. there is a invisible hole and needed to noclip to get out of it
F.. those chains r rock solid as the bushes

also found out that the sound of the torches is not tourches but more a annoying ticking and when the flying enemy show there is also a annoying sound playing, maybe good idea check that with others to see if they have the same problem
all this happen on the level 24, 25 and 27 :) hope it help ^_^
see u around and hope all is well with u and the proyects ;)

yeah i see that u upload a new version and i was able to played on gzdoom 1.9 :P even it was just a little ;)
with batman, i did try to see if i could get some sprite, but nothing good came :/
with the sound also i did a check to see and there was something about a tool to extract the sounds from batman arkan city or asylum, dont remember which one

i made my way to the penguin and damn, that guy is hard ¬¬ for a umbrella that shit hit hard and i mean it in few times he kill me very fast, the only problem i did have was to hit it, the sprite is close to the floor but it seem the hit spot is in the center or close, so i needed to make arcs with the smoke bomb to kill him
im working on the scarecrow levels and there some few things on the maps i will give u a description and pick for u to check ;)

here there is some sprite out of place
in all these sections there was a huge problem with sounds, maybe too much sounds runing at the same time??
here the fire dont sound at all like fire more like a bip bip bip very weird  :?

well i have played some more and i notice that the chinese enemies the one that throw you stars, when they hit u with their claws it make a matalic sound hit, maybe if the sound will be a ripping or tearing clothes will be more accurate and also the big guy with knife too ;)

the pick up ammo for the smoke bomb and weapons in general is the shotgun one :P

will be tell more as i do more progress, oh and the Tally Man was not hard, maybe if you wanna make him move faster will be a hard enemy 

Tormentor667 suggestions:
*- Fuel Cans shouldn't glow green
*- Fuel Can explosions are missing GLDEFs
*- Fire objects need GLDEFs
*- Enhancement: What about choosing a better background for the intermission texts? (or even a better smallfont that fits the rest)
*- The Flamethrowerguys Idle GLDEFs are too large/bright and are glowing even when he's dead
*- Playerclass is too tall, you can't enter some areas anymore without crouching (suggestion: keep viewheight as it is, make player as large as normal doomguy)
*- Pistol Ganngsters firing are missing GLDEFs when firing
*- Ammo Maxamount for tossable bombs is definitely too high I guess... I am at MAP19 now and have collected about 960 pieces.
*- Exploding Penguins need GLDEFs
*- Collecting the Berserk Pack doesn't automatically switch to fist
*- Enhancement: What about replacing the doomguy sounds with better ones? (pain, death, etc)
*- Chinese Melee monsters (the one with the too blades) seem too slow to me compared to the original Batman Doom (2x faster)
*- Fire-tossing enemies need GLDEFs (also their projectiles)
- MAP31 isn't beatable anymore - maybe I did something wrong, but please anyone confirm this
- MAP32 has a HOM effect at the very start
